/**
 * browser-lifecycle — observes whether a process that opened a session exits.
 * See design.md §6.3.
 *
 * Runs the work in a child process and watches from the parent. A process
 * cannot reliably report whether it would itself have hung, so an in-process
 * implementation of this check would be meaningless.
 *
 * Two deadlines, both bounded, so the parent always terminates:
 *   - `launchBudgetMs` to reach the moment the browser is closed
 *   - `deadlines.childExitMs` for the child to exit *after* that moment
 *
 * The exit deadline runs from the close, not from spawn. A live launch was
 * measured at ~3.1s, so a deadline running from spawn would report a healthy
 * slow network as a hang.
