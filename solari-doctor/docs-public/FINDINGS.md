# 1. Evidence standard

Every claim here carries the evidence actually obtained for it. Status is given
**per claim**, never as a blanket assurance, because the levels genuinely
differ.

### Evidence levels

| Level | Name | What it proves |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **L1** | Static | Read from source, type declarations, docs, or git history |
| **L2** | Unit | Deterministic logic, exercised by the test suite |
| **L3** | Integration | A real call against the real SDK |
| **L4** | Runtime | Actual process, resource, or lifecycle behaviour |

### Status labels

| Label | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| **Confirmed** | Reproduced directly, at the level shown. A correction may be noted where the documented wording is imprecise |
| **Partial** | The observable part was reproduced; another part of the claim was not, and is named |
| **Unresolved** | Sources disagree, or the evidence needed is out of this project's reach |

# 2. Final status at a glance

## The README gotchas

Five gotchas, listed as six claims — gotcha 2 makes two separable ones, and they
did not land the same way.

| # | Claim | Status | Evidence |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | `browser.close()` is enough to exit as of 0.1.3 | **Confirmed** | **L4** — A/B against real 0.1.2 and 0.1.3 installs |
| 2a | Recording is per session, not per account | **Confirmed** | **L3** — a parallel control session, without `recording: true`, 404'd for 240s |
| 2b | "poll for ~30s before giving up" | **Unresolved** — measurement disagrees | **L3** — three runs: 404 through 60s, replay at 8.2s, 404 through 46s |
| 3 | Sandbox commands are not shell-interpreted | **Confirmed**, with a correction | **L3** — the raw form *throws `ActionError`*; it does not exit non-zero |
| 4 | `kill()`, not `close()`, ends a VM | **Confirmed**, with a correction | **L4** — termination shows as a **404**, not a state transition |
| 5 | `timeoutMs` is a rolling idle window | **Partial** | **L3** — a sandbox's `expiresAt` advanced after activity. The window was never driven to expiry, and no check depends on it |

> Gotcha 5 is in unresolved tension with issue #25, which reports sessions
> ending long before any documented deadline. Neither was measured against the
> other.

## The three cited issues

Referenced in check output, and **not** verified to the same degree. The checks
are worded to match.

| Issue | Subject | Status | What was actually done |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| [**#1**](https://github.com/solari-sdk/solari-cookbook/issues/1) | The key-creation modal loses the secret | **Partial** | The console UI event is unobservable from a CLI and was never reproduced. The downstream failures were: a truncated key producing a 401, and a key carrying a pasted line break being rejected before the request is sent |
| [**#25**](https://github.com/solari-sdk/solari-cookbook/issues/25) | Sessions end at ~10 min while the status endpoint says `active` | **Partial** | All three liveness signals confirmed live (L4). The ~10-minute death itself was **not** reproduced — it needs a 10-minute idle run, outside this project's scope by design |
| [**#27**](https://github.com/solari-sdk/solari-cookbook/issues/27) | Go examples need an explicit `-base-url` | **Not reproducible here** | It is a Go issue and this is a TypeScript tool. Corroborated cross-language instead — see [§3.7](#37-sdk-version-discovery-and-the-esm-constraint) |

---

# 3. Verified Solari behaviour

## 3.1 Browser lifecycle — 0.1.2 vs 0.1.3

`@solarisdk/browser` keeps a loopback proxy open for connection retries. Before
0.1.3 that listener held Node's event loop open, so a script that called
`browser.close()` without also calling `solari.close()` printed its output and
then hung. **0.1.3 unrefs the listener.**

Measured directly — same script, same account, one variable:

| Version | Calls | Result |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **0.1.2** | `browser.close()` only | **Hung** — killed at 75s |
| **0.1.3** | `browser.close()` only | **Exited in ~3s** |

*(**L4**.)*

This is why `sdk-version` and `browser-lifecycle` are **separate checks**: a
version read shows *exposure*, a lifecycle observation shows a *symptom*, and
only together do they name the documented bug.

> **A stale comment in the cookbook.** The README gotcha was corrected when
> 0.1.3 shipped, but the TypeScript examples still told readers `solari.close()`
> was required. Fixed and open upstream as
> [solari-cookbook#47](https://github.com/solari-sdk/solari-cookbook/pull/47) — a documentation fix this
> work surfaced, not part of this project.

## 3.2 Authentication and the error model

`@solarisdk/browser` exports exactly **one** error class:

```ts
class SolariError extends Error {
  readonly status?: number;
  readonly cause?: unknown;
  readonly code?: SolariErrorCode | string;
}
```

`@solarisdk/core` — re-exported by `@solarisdk/sdk` and `@solarisdk/sandbox` —
exports a **full hierarchy** instead:

```
SolariError
├── GatewayError
│   ├── AuthError
│   ├── PlanError
│   ├── ConcurrencyLimitError
│   └── NoCapacityError
├── ActionError
├── TimeoutError
└── ConnectionError
```

The same split exists in the Go SDKs, so it is a property of the **products**
rather than of TypeScript.

**Two consequences before writing any error handling:**

1. **The two `SolariError` classes are different classes.** A browser error is
   not `instanceof` the core one, or vice versa. A cross-package `instanceof`
   returns `false` silently — no crash, no type error, just a branch that never
   fires. *(**L1**.)*
2. **`code` is `undefined` for a 401 on both SDKs.** Authentication must be
   detected from `status === 401`; matching auth on an error code never fires.
   *(**L3** — verified with a deliberately invalid key against both clients.)*

## 3.3 Sandbox `close()` vs `kill()`

`close()` is **synchronous** and drops only the local control channel. `kill()`
destroys the VM and is **idempotent**.

| Step | `sandboxes.get()` reports |
|:--|:--|
| After `close()` | `state: "running"` — the VM is still there |
| After `kill()` | **404** — the record is gone |

*(**L4**.)* Termination is confirmed by the record disappearing, **not** by a
state transition. That is the correction to gotcha 4's wording.

The response carries **no billing field of any kind**, which is why the check's
wording stops at *"may result in continued resource consumption/billing"* and
never claims a cost was incurred.

## 3.4 Sandbox command semantics

| Call | Outcome |
|:--|:--|
| `run("ls -la")` | **Throws `ActionError`** — it does not merely exit non-zero |
| `run("ls", { args: ["-la", "/tmp"] })` | Succeeds |
| `run("sh", { args: ["-c", "..."] })` | The way to get pipes, globs or redirection |

*(**L3**.)* The correction to gotcha 3 is the *throw*: code that checks an exit
code will never see one.

## 3.5 Session liveness

All three signals issue #25 names as reliable were confirmed against a session
released server-side *(**L4**)*:

1. `isConnected()` flipped to `false`
2. The `disconnected` event fired
3. A subsequent page call threw

> **The thrown class arrived as `TargetClosedError2`** — a bundler-renamed
> Playwright-family error from `patchright-core`, not a Solari export. Matching
> on that name would break on any rebuild, so `isConnected()` is the primary
> signal and the class name is recorded as **evidence only**.

## 3.6 Recording is per session

Two sessions run in parallel from the same account and polled for 240s:

| Session | `recording` at create | Replay |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **A** | `true` | Available after **8.2s** (`expiresInSeconds: 900`, `contentEncoding: "gzip"`) |
| **B** (control) | omitted | **404 for the entire 240s** |

*(**L3**.)* The control is what makes this conclusive: B reproduced the README's
*"without it the replay endpoint 404s forever"* precisely, while A produced a
replay from the same account minutes apart.

> **There is no confirmation signal.** The `Session` object returned by
> `sessions.create()` exposes `id`, `wsEndpoint`, `cdpEndpoint`, `expiresAt`,
> `storageState?` and `proxy?` — and nothing about recording. A 404 cannot be
> distinguished from a slow upload without waiting. See [§5.1](#51-replay-timing-and-reliability).

## 3.7 SDK version discovery and the ESM constraint

`@solarisdk/browser/package.json` is **not an exported subpath**, so importing
it throws `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. The package is also **ESM-only** —
its `exports` map declares `types` and `import` with no `require` condition — so
CommonJS cannot load it at all. *(**L1**.)*

`sdk-version` therefore reads the manifest **from the filesystem, anchored at
the user's project root**. That anchoring matters: `solari-doctor` depends on
the same package, so module resolution would report *its own* version and the
check would always pass.

**A second discovery constraint, from issue #27.** The Go issue is not
reproducible here, but the same shape exists in the TypeScript packages:

| Package | `baseUrl` |
|:--|:--|
| `@solarisdk/sdk` → `SolariClient` | Defaults to `https://api.getsolari.com` |
| `@solarisdk/sandbox` → `SandboxClient` | Declared `baseUrl: string` — **required, no `?`** — with no default |

*(**L1**, from the published `.d.ts`.)* The same defect in a second language is
evidence that it belongs to the **standalone packages** rather than to one SDK.
It decided a design choice: the sandbox checks use `SolariClient`, because the
standalone client would have forced this tool to hardcode a gateway address.

# 4. Bugs found while verifying solari-doctor

Five defects in this tool, none of which the unit suite caught. They are
recorded because the pattern matters more than the individual bugs: **unit tests
verify units, and these defects lived in the wiring between them.**

## 4.1 A live-environment wiring bug

Shipped with 194 passing tests, including 21 for `auth`. The first real run:

```
$ node --env-file=.env dist/bin.js
  x auth  SOLARI_API_KEY is not set  0ms
```

The key was present and the check reported it missing. `runCli` built its
context with `createDoctorContext()` and no arguments, so `apiKey` was always
`undefined` — **nothing read `process.env`.** Every test passed because each one
either injected a context directly or deliberately supplied no key, so the one
path that mattered in production was the one path nothing exercised.

**The fix is not "read env inside the context."** That would make the whole unit
suite depend on the shell running it: a developer with a key exported would see
different results from CI, and the missing-key tests would fail for them alone.
The environment is injected at the composition root instead — `CliDeps.env`,
defaulting to `{}`, with `main()` passing `process.env`.

*(**L4**. After the fix: `+ auth  the API key authenticated successfully  942ms`.)*

## 4.2 A shared client closed by a borrower

Found by the first run of all seven checks together. Every per-check run had
already passed.

```
FAIL  recording-lifecycle  the recording probe could not run: an unrecognised error
      evidence: { "errorClass": "Error", "sanitizedMessage": "LocalProxy not started" }
```

`ctx.browser()` memoises one `Solari` instance so the checks share a client
rather than opening seven. Both browser checks then called `solari.close()` in
their own `finally`. `session-liveness` runs first, closed the shared client,
and `recording-lifecycle` inherited a dead one.

Each check was individually correct. The defect exists only in the composition.

**Fix: the owner disposes, not the borrower.** `DoctorContext` gained
`dispose()`, the CLI calls it once after every check has finished, and no check
closes a client it did not create. *(**L4**.)*

## 4.3 A unit test reaching the live API

Two CLI tests ran `runCli` without injecting a registry, so they used the real
one. Once all seven checks were registered, `auth` began making a genuine
`sandboxes.list()` call during `npm test` — a live network request in a suite
required to be hermetic.

It surfaced as a **flaky** failure, not an obvious one: it passed on re-run,
which is the characteristic signature of a suite that depends on the network.

Both tests now inject a one-check registry that records the `apiKey` it was
handed — testing the wiring the cases were actually about, without a request.
*(**L2**.)*

## 4.4 Two checks disagreeing about the same environment

Found by an integrated run from a directory with no `@solarisdk/browser`
installed:

```
!  sdk-version        @solarisdk/browser is not installed under <tmpdir>
x  browser-lifecycle  the harness failed: SdkNotFound
exit 1
```

Both checks observed the same condition and disagreed about its severity.
`sdk-version` treats *"the SDK is not here"* as **cannot determine** and warns;
`browser-lifecycle` treated it as a failure. Because a `fail` exits 1, running
the tool in any directory without the SDK reported a broken environment when
nothing was wrong.

**Fixed:** `SdkNotFound` now maps to `warn`, with wording matching
`sdk-version`'s. The same directory now reports `4 passed · 2 warned`, exit `0`.
*(**L4**.)*

## 4.5 Security and redaction findings

Four defects from an adversarial pass against the finished tool — a deliberate
attempt to break it rather than to confirm it works. Two are security defects.
All four are reachable only through a malformed key or a hostile filesystem.

**Key material survived redaction past a whitespace character.** The redaction
pattern stopped at the first character outside the key's character class, so a
key broken by a pasted newline kept its tail:

```
'Headers.append: "Bearer slr_live_aaaa\nSECRETTAIL" is invalid'
  ->  'Headers.append: "Bearer slr_***redacted***\nSECRETTAIL" is invalid'
                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^ key material
```

This was a live channel, not a hypothetical: the SDK echoes the whole
`Authorization` header when it rejects one, and that message reaches `--report`.
**Fixed** by redacting the entire `Bearer` value before the key pattern runs.

**A newline in the key produced a diagnosis about the transport.** The same key
reported *"the control connection is not open"*. `fetch` rejects an invalid
header before any connection is attempted, and the mapper classified the result
as a connection error — technically defensible, diagnostically useless, on the
exact failure mode issue #1 documents. **Fixed:** `auth` now tests the key for
header-legal characters before spending a call, and reports the character
problem directly.

> Worth naming what the fix does *not* reject: **tab and space are legal in an
> HTTP header value**, so they are allowed. The first version of that test
> asserted they should fail, which was wrong — over-rejecting would fail a key
> the API would have accepted.

**A failed report write discarded the run's verdict.** `--report` to an
unwritable path threw out of the CLI and exited **2 — usage error** — even
though the diagnosis had already been printed. A healthy environment reported as
a usage error. **Fixed:** the write is wrapped, a failure warns on stderr, and
the check-derived exit code stands. *(**L4** — against a real read-only file:
`2` → `0`.)*

**A hostile evidence key reshaped the sanitised object.** `output[key] = value`
with `key === "__proto__"` sets the object's **prototype** rather than creating
a property. `Object.prototype` was never polluted — the payload landed on the
local object — but the sanitiser's output silently acquired a hostile prototype,
and the key it was asked to preserve vanished. **Fixed** with
`Object.defineProperty`.

## 4.6 CI was red on Node 20 from the very first push

The badge was never checked after the workflows were added. The Actions API
showed **four consecutive failed runs**, one per push, all failing identically:

```
ubuntu-latest  · node 24   success
ubuntu-latest  · node 20   failure  -> step "npm ci --ignore-scripts"
windows-latest · node 24   success
windows-latest · node 20   failure  -> step "npm ci --ignore-scripts"
```

Never the tests — always the install, and only on Node 20.

**Cause:** two deliberate decisions combining into one nobody made.
`vitest@5.0.0` requires `^22.12.0 || ^24.0.0 || >=26.0.0`, excluding Node 20;
`.npmrc` sets `engine-strict=true`, which turns npm's engine warning into a hard
failure. `engine-strict` was added with the comment *"Fail loudly if Node is
older than a package requires (SDK needs >= 20)"* — and it did, for a
**devDependency**, on the version the matrix pinned.

Reproduced locally to confirm rather than infer, by patching a scratch copy of
the lockfile to give vitest an impossible range:

| Command | Result |
|:--|:--|
| `npm ci --ignore-scripts` | **`EBADENGINE`** on the devDependency |
| `npm ci --ignore-scripts --omit=dev` | Succeeded — devDependency engines are not evaluated |

**Why local gates never caught it:** development ran on Node v24.19.0
throughout, and `npm run check` cannot fail on a constraint that only binds on
20. Every production dependency does admit Node 20, and `lockfileVersion` is
`3`, which npm 10 reads — so neither is implicated.

**The fix, and the one deliberately not taken.** Dropping Node 20 from the
matrix would have made the badge green and quietly abandoned the
`engines.node >= 20` claim in `package.json`. Instead the full gate runs on Node
22 and 24 — **all four legs now green** — and a separate `runtime-node20` job
verifies the claim actually made to users, against the built output and
production dependencies only.

### The second failure, and why the first explanation did not survive

That new job then failed at its own install step, and the obvious answer — that
`engine-strict` still evaluates vitest's range — had just been *disproved* by
the table above. Rather than guess again, one more experiment held everything
constant except the npm version:

| npm | `npm ci --ignore-scripts --omit=dev` (same lockfile, same Node) |
|:--|:--|
| **11.17.0** | Succeeds — devDependency engines not evaluated |
| **10.9.9** | **`EBADENGINE` on vitest** |

**npm 10 evaluates devDependency engine ranges even under `--omit=dev`; npm 11
does not.** Node 20 ships npm 10, while development here runs npm 11 on Node 24
— which is exactly why the same command passed locally and failed in CI.

Fixed by upgrading npm in that job, and **the workflow is now green on every
job.** The alternative, `--engine-strict=false`, was rejected: `engine-strict`
is the mechanism that would catch a **production** dependency dropping Node 20,
which is the whole point of the job.

*(**L4**.)* A CI badge is a claim like any other, and this one had not been
verified: four red runs sat in the Actions tab while the local suite was green.
The wider lesson is that "it reproduces locally" was not sufficient either —
the local environment differed from CI in a variable nobody had enumerated.

# 5. What remains unresolved

None of these block the tool. All are recorded rather than resolved.

## 5.1 Replay timing and reliability

Three live runs of the recording cycle disagree:

| Run | Session activity | Poll schedule | Result |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | one `goto` | every 2s for 60s | **404 on all 25 polls** |
| 2 | two `goto`s + 1.5s dwell | every 5s for 240s | **Replay at 8.2s** |
| 3 | one `goto`, via the built check | every 2s for 45s | **404 on all 20 polls**, stopped at 46,020 ms |

Solari's own figures disagree too:

| Source | Figure |
|:--|:--|
| SDK doc comment on `getReplayUrl` | *"Available ~1-3s after `releaseAndWait`"* |
| Cookbook README, gotcha 2 | *"poll for ~30s before giving up"* |

Two of three runs produced **no replay at all**, so the open question is not
*"how long does the upload take"* but *"does a replay reliably appear"*. Since
there is no confirmation signal on the `Session` object ([§3.6](#36-recording-is-per-session)),
a 404 at the 30s mark is ambiguous between a slow upload and recording never
having been on.

`recording-lifecycle` therefore reports a timeout as **inconclusive**, states
Solari's documented figure and this project's polling ceiling as **separate
numbers**, and does not claim a guarantee was breached.

## 5.2 Session expiry discrepancy

| Source | Value |
|:--|:--|
| Issue #25, Starter tier | `createdAt + 5h` |
| Measured here | `createdAt + 1h` |

The plan tier of this account is unknown, so the two are not necessarily in
conflict and the discrepancy is **unresolved**.

It changes nothing in the tool — `session-liveness` is structural and never
trusts `expiresAt` or the status endpoint — but it is one more reason not to.

## 5.3 `PROTOCOL.md` is not publicly available

Three SDK READMEs reference an authoritative protocol contract —
`sdk/PROTOCOL.md` from the Rust SDK, `../PROTOCOL.md` from the Go one — that is
**not present in any public repository**, and the `sdk/` directory they point at
has no public counterpart.

Cross-SDK protocol conformance is therefore out of scope, and this project makes
no claim about wire compatibility.

**Three questions for the maintainers, whenever convenient:**

1. Does `PROTOCOL.md` exist in a private or internal location?
2. Is it available through another repository or path?
3. Or is cross-SDK conformance intentionally outside the public surface?

---

# 6. Final verification summary

Measured at the current commit, not quoted from an earlier run.

| Gate | Command | Result |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Tests** | `npm test` | **347 passing, 15 files.** No test reaches a live service |
| **Typecheck** | `npm run typecheck` | **Exit 0** — source and tests, strict + `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` |
| **Lint** | `npm run lint` | **Exit 0** — including the layer-purity rules |
| **Build** | `npm run build` | **Exit 0** |

**Live checks — 7/7.** Every check was run against the real SDK before being
considered complete, including the A/B against real 0.1.2 and 0.1.3 installs.

**CI — every job green.** The PR gate runs typecheck · lint · test · build on
ubuntu and windows across Node 22 and 24. Node 20 is excluded from the gate for
the reason in [§4.6](#46-ci-was-red-on-node-20-from-the-very-first-push), and is
covered instead by a `runtime-node20` job that installs production dependencies
only and runs the built CLI there — so the `engines.node >= 20` claim in
`package.json` is verified rather than assumed.
